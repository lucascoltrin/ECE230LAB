## Lab Questions
In this lab we learned how flipflops differ from latches and how to use them

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
Edge circuits capture a single snapshot of the circuit, where level use all data when clock is active
### Why is it important to declare initial state?
It is important so we don't have an unknown state at the beginning, which would make jk flip flop not work for example.
### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
They allow us to build stable counters.

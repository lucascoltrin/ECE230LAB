## Lab Questions

In this lab we learned how to create a subtractor, and how to add ones compliment and convert to twos compliment.

### 1 - Explain the differences between our Half Adder from last lab and the Half Subtractor from this lab.
The truth table for the output of both is the same and is XOR. The diffrence is instead of using a carry like the
half adder does, the half subtractor uses a borrow.
### 2 - What about the end around carry of One’s Complement makes it hard to use and implement?
Because of the end around carry, you have to add each bit twice.
### 3 - What is the edge case and problem with Two’s Complement number representation?
When adding a number at the top of the range, it will display a negative that is incorrect, rather than a positive that is correct or vice versa.

## Lab Questions
In this lab we learned about state machines using one hot and binary encodings.

### Compare and contrast One Hot and Binary encodings
One hot is easier to write the logic but requires more space due to more DFFs, while binary is harder to write logic but requires less space.
### Which method did your team find easier, and why?
One hot was easier as the logic was much simpler, even though it required two more DFFs.
### In what conditions would you have to use one over the other? Think about resource utilization on the FPGA.
When you have limited space, you would use binary, otherwise, use the one hot implementation.

## Lab Questions
In this lab we learned how adders work in Verilog and how to combine them to add more bits together.
### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
Use 2 or more full adders.
### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The XOR gate gives the sum.
### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest input is 11 or 3, and the largest output is 110 or 6. If you go over, it will output a smaller number than the actual answer.

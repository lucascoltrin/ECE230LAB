## Lab Questions
In this lab we learned how to make basic computer memory using latches and multiplexers

###  Why can we not just use structural Verilog to implement latches?
Because it does not support combinatorial loops.
### What is the meaning of always @(*) in a sensitivity block?
It means you can use any variable, because no memeory is required for this block.
### What importance is memory to digital circuits?
It can store states which allows for more advanced operations.

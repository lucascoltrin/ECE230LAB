## Lab Questions
In this lab we learned how to use Multiplexers and Demultiplexers and how to combine them together.
### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer is used to take many inputs and select one of them to be used as the output.
### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer is used to take one input and route it to one of many outputs.
### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
These multiplexers can be used to build any Boolean circuit using Shannon's Theorem.
